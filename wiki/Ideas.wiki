= Introduction =

This is the ideas sheet to jot information down. Unfiltered, unformatted.


= Details =

Things to keep in mind going forward:
  *  tab layout; order of information and navigation workflow to match the real user workflow. For example
  *  help in identifying symbols, ambiguous information - something to be aware of when user-testing
  *  information grouping on the page - again match the workflow
 

Layout ideas (to experiment):
  *  I forget.

Design concerns/ideas:
  *  Help user make informed decisions.  But check that design/features does not interfere with the decision/responsibility distribution of the relief organization.
