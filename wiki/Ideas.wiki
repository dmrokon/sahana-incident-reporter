= Introduction =

This is the ideas sheet to jot information down. Unfiltered, unformatted.


= Details =

Things to keep in mind going forward:
  *  tab layout; order of information and navigation workflow to match the real user workflow. For example
  *  help in identifying symbols, ambiguous information - something to be aware of when user-testing
  *  information grouping on the page - again match the workflow
 

Layout ideas (to experiment):
  *  I forget.

Design concerns/ideas:
  *  Help user make informed decisions.  But check that design/features does not interfere with the decision/responsibility distribution of the relief organization.
  *  When people scroll through incident list, have some identifier in the list (preferably picto- because it's easier/quicker to visually distinguish) so people can tell different incidents of the same category or impact apart.
  *   UI of recording location on the form?  (Goal: (1) accurately record location so that it's retraceable but (2) save recorder's time.)
